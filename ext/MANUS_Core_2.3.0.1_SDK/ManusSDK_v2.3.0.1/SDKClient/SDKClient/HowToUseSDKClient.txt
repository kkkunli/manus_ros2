Welcome to the most least-likely-to-be-read file in this SDK.
but its important if you want to use the SDK.

when you unpack the SDKClient zip you will also find:
- docs				(directory)
	this contains all the doxygen generated documentation of the SDKClient
- ManusSDK			(directory)
	- ManusSDK.Lib  
		the main SDK lib you will need to talk with Manus Core
	- ManusSDK.dll
		the main SDK dll you will need to talk with Manus Core
- PlatformSpecific			(directory)
	- ClientPlatformSpecific.hpp
		this contains some platform specific functions, currently they are made only for Windows. 
	- Windows				(directory)
		-	ClientPlatformSpecific.cpp
		-	ClientPlatformSpecificTypes.hpp

- ManusSDKTypes.h
	this contains all the specific types and enumerators used in the SDK.
- ManusSDKTypeInitializers.h
	this contains all the initializers for the structs used in the SDK.
- Main.cpp
	this contains the main function that starts this example sdk client.
- ManusSDK.h
	The interface header for the SDK DLL. this describes all the functions available to the user.
- SDKClient.cpp
	This contains all the logic and basic examples to use the SDK. It is only meant as an example on how to work with the
	SDK DLL and not as a template how your own client implementation should look.	
- SDKClient.hpp
	Header file
- SDKClient.vcxproj
	project file
- packages.config
	This is a third party nuget package reference for logging purposes and is used by the SDKClient.
	if this is not installed on your system use nuget to restore the spdlog_native 2021.7.30 package. 
	However Visual studio usually automatically restores the nuget package when you build the solution.
	
This project will build with visual studio 2019 and 2022 on windows 10/11

Important project settings
	- c++
		- language
			- C++ language standard
				for backwards compatibility the SDK is compiled on the ISO C++ 17 standard.
			- Precompiled headers
				Not using Precompiled Headers
	- linker
		- Additional Library Directories
			$(ProjectDir)ManusSDK
				this is for the ManusSDK.dll/lib files
		- Input
			- Additional Dependencies
				ManusSDK.lib
		- System
			- SubSystem
				Console
				the SDKClient example outputs to the console, but your client may differ. adjust as is needed for your client.
				
The default SDKClient.vcxproj already has the above settings in both Debug and Release mode and should compile and run out of the box.

To run succesfully also run Manus Tray or console version and preferably with a dongle and glove connected to the same PC.

When running the client you can run it 
	-	local	
		it will search the localhost for a manus instance to connect to.
	-	host
		it will search for manus instances on the network
		then give the user the option to select a host
		and then connect to that host.
		Note network security software may interfere with this. Make sure the network allows manus to be run.		
	-	grpcpreset
		in certain cases its better to direct the SDK client to the host more directly.
		it will not search the network and just directly connect to a host on the address and port.
			the GRPC preset is stored in the manus core settings file ManusCore.Coordinator.json which can be 
			found in the windows appdata directory %appdata%/../local/Manus/ManusCore
			
	Once running and connected it will show some of the available data as reported by the Manus Host.
